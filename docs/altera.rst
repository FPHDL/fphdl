Altera Quartus
##############

**Tested with Altera Quartus 2 version 9.2**

First, enter Quartus, and create a project.
Next, add the files ``fixed_float_types_c.vhdl``, ``fixed_pkg_c.vhdl`` and
``float_pkg_c.vhdl`` to the project.
Quartus seems to simply ignore library names, so you can just run from there.

When loaded, hit the "run" arrow.  This will take some time to run, but it
seems to give a functional result.

I needed to modify no files for this version of Quartus.
