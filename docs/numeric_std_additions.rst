 <a href="numeric_std_additions.vhdl">numeric_std_additions.vhdl</a> -- Additions to the package "ieee.numeric_std"
</p>
<p>
   Use model:<br>
  <b>use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;<br>
   use ieee.numeric_std.all;<br>
   use ieee_proposed.numeric_std_additions.all;</b>
</p><p>
   Dependencies:  ieee.std_logic_1164, ieee.numeric_std
</p>
<ul>
   <li> SIGNED or UNSIGNED + std_ulogic operators
   <li> SIGNED or UNSIGNED - std_ulogic operators
   <li> type UNRESOLVED_UNSIGNED (aliased to U_UNSIGNED) is an unresolved
      verion of UNSIGNED.  It is aliased to "UNSIGNED" for compatability.
   <li> type UNRESOLVED_SIGNED (aliased to U_SIGNED) is an unresolved
      verion of SIGNED.  It is aliased to "SIGNED" for compatability.
  <li> \?=\, \?/=\ - similar to "std_match", but return std_ulogic values.
      \?&lt\, \?&lt=\, \?&gt\, \?&gt=\ - compare functions which retrun std_ulogic.
      (these will be "?="... operators in the release)
   <li> To_X01, To_X01Z, To_U01X, Is_X - same as std_logic_1164 functions,
      but overloaded for SIGNED and UNSIGNED.
   <li> "sla" and "sra" - Mathmetically correct versions of these functions.
  <li> minimum and maximum - smaller or larger of two SIGNED or UNSIGNED values.
   <li> find_leftmost and find_rightmost - finds the first bit in a string.<br>
       Example:<br>
     <b>find_leftmost (c12, '1'); -- returns the Log2 of "c12".</b>
     returns -1 if not found.
   <li> _reduce functions (and_reduce, nand_reduce, or_reduce ...) are defined
      These functions reduce a SIGNED or an UNSIGNED to a single bit.
      (will overload the "or" and "and", ... operators in the release)
   <li> SIGNED or UNSIGNED and "std_ulogic" operations are defined. 
      These will perform a boolean operation of a vector.  <br>Example:<br>
      <b>"1" xor "1010" = "0101";</b>
   <li> READ and WRITE procedures for "SIGNED", and "UNSIGNED" are defined.
   <li> HREAD and HWRITE (Hex read and write) for SIGNED and UNSIGNED.
      These are more "forgiving" than the ones
      originally from "std_logic_textio"
   <li> OREAD and OWRITE (octal read and write) for "SIGNED" and "UNSIGNED.
      These are more "forgiving" than the ones
      originally from "std_logic_textio"
   <li> BREAD and BWRITE (binary read and write, same as "READ" and "WRITE" for
      SIGNED and UNSIGNED.
   <li> to_string function - Converts a "SIGNED" or "UNSIGNED" types into a
      string.  Example: <br>
      <b>assert (UNS = "101") report "result was " & to_string(UNS) severity note;</b>
   <li> to_hstring and to_ostring function (SIGNED or UNSIGNED to hex or octal
      string)

</ul>
